### What is an icon font?

An icon font is a font that contains images. Kinda like the font
`Symbols` in the good old MS Word. 
Not only it can contain symbols but also glyphs.


### Why do we need this?

An icon font is very popular with current web developers because its possible
to style icons the same way as you can style regular text.


### Why just not PNG for all icons?
